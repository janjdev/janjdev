🚀 Full Stack Developer | Problem Solver | Lifelong Learner

### Hi there 👋🏿

👋🏿 Hello! I'm January Johnson, a versatile full-stack developer passionate about crafting dynamic web solutions and harnessing the power of technology to solve real-world challenges. My extensive skill set encompasses a wide range of technologies, including HTML, CSS3, JavaScript, Node.js, React, Angular, Python, Django, Flask, Java, Hibernate, Spring, R, machine-learning, MongoDB, MySQL, and PostgreSQL.

🎓 I'm pursuing an MS in Computer Science and Cyber Security at the University of Missouri-Saint Louis. My educational journey started with a Bachelor of Science in Information Systems and Technology, and I also hold a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration with a focus on finance.

🛠️ In my current role as a Software Engineer at JAKAPA, I'm responsible for backend development. I design and develop robust, scalable, and high-performance APIs for the Jakapa app. Collaborating closely with the lead developer and CTO, I ensure our APIs are secure, adhere to industry best practices, and deliver an outstanding user experience.

💼 Before this, I honed my skills as a full-stack developer during a freelancing stint, working on diverse projects that sharpened my adaptability and problem-solving abilities.

🌟 My areas of expertise extend beyond coding. I'm deeply committed to the entire software development lifecycle, from conceptualization to deployment, and I thrive on optimizing processes and finding elegant solutions to complex challenges.

🔍 Let's connect and explore how we can leverage technology to create innovative solutions, whether it's optimizing business processes, developing cutting-edge applications, or exploring the world of data science and machine learning.
